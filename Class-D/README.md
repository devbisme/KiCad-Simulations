## Another Class-D 2.5 kW audio amplifier
with half bridge MOS driver and a 'home made' audio driver circuit model (pwm, non-inverted and inverted outputs, dead-time, hi-side and low-side outputs).

The simple Class-D-s uses the one-shot PWM (already available in ngspice-41 and older), the slightly more complex Class-D uses the somewhat faster new PWM from ngspice-42.
