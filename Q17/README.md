## Q17, a redesign of the famous QUAD405 High-End Audio Amplifier, 
made by Tiberiu Vicol (https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/q17-a-quad405-audiophile-approach-to-perfect-sound.374507/). He designed circuit and PCB with KiCad, I have modified his files to enable simulation with KiCad/ngspice.
