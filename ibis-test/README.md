## IBIS interface simulation
Some "finger execises" in the new IBIS module are shown next. IBIS allows to simulate drivers and receivers (the I/O of ICs and their connections) without resorting to the inner functions of the participating ICs. Typically a sequence "Driver -- Interconnecting tracks -- Receiver" is simulated. Still somewhat experimental.
